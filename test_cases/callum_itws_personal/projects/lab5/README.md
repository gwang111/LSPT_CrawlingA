# ITWS 1100 Lab 5

In this lab we started working with some JavaScript. We used it to do some simple form validation to make sure there weren't blank fields, as well as focus on blank fields after clicking submit, removing placeholder text, and creating a nickname popup. I think it was a pretty good introduction to using JavaScript and calling it from our HTML files/using it to edit HTML. The hardest part of this lab for me was making it so that the form would validate even if the user entered the placeholder text, while still not validating if they didn't enter anything but the entry in the field was still the same. I solved that with a variable that keeps track if the user edited the field or not.
