## Struggles

Padding sucks. Lots of things add it by default and working in raw HTML/CSS means you have to actually deal with those defaults and fix them. There was also a lot of fiddling with CSS since I'm not used to working in raw CSS and using selectors as much. I also had to put some effort into obey XHTML 1.0 Strict. There are a lot of things that aren't required in normal HTML that are required when it's strict, so I had to spend some time fixed those things.
