# ITWS 1100 Lab 4

In this lab we created our own RSS and Atom feeds, learning about each format in the process. RSS is an older but more widely used standard, and Atom is the more modern (and living) specification. This lab didn't seem too complicated, but it would have been a lot easier if I had just made up my own items/entries for RSS/Atom instead of grabbing them from 5 different sources. I learned that most sites on the internet still use RSS, and supplement it with updated namespaces to add more specialized tags, the most common being dc (<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> and media (<http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/>). Atom is less common than I thought it would be, especially since it was originally released in 2005. Another problem is that so many sites have RSS or Atom data that doesn't even validate! I had to spend the majority of this lab fixing all the different errors in the items/entries that I grabbed so that my RSS/Atom files would validate properly.
