# ITWS 1100 Lab 6

This lab was working with jQuery. I learned that jQuery can be a lot easier to work with than vanilla JS, because there are a lot of built-in functions that make tedious things much faster and easier to code. I really didn't have much trouble with the lab once I got started so I  finished it pretty quickly. I added a little extra JS that changes the color of my name a 2nd time if you click on it again. I'm excited to start working on making our projects sometime.
