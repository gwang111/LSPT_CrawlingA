# ITWS 1100 Lab 3

## Thoughts

This was a pretty good lab, especially for introducing/making us think about the structure of a website and how we can actually start accomplishing that. I learned that I like it more when a design or idea is given to me and I have to implement it, vs having to think about and design the layout of each page in a website. Figuring out how to setup the website on the backend is pretty nice, however. This lab I tried to deal with flexbox stuff and it was kind of annoying at first. I might try CSS Grid in the future, cause I saw that that one also seemed pretty useful, and also newer.
