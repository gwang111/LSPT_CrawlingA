## Question 1

I decided to use the Menu widget for my website home page beause I thought it was the best-fitting element to replace what I had before. I also chose it because I was able to nest each of the labs underneath the projects link, which was pretty cool. I went to <https://jqueryui.com/demos/> to learn about the different widgets and get sample code to help start with implementing it. After putting the base code in I added a bit of CSS to center it and make it a bit bigger to fit the display better. As for the Projects page, I used the Tabs widget because I felt that it fit a lot better, and the user could just tab through each lab without leaving the page. Since I still needed links and the modals for lab descriptions, I used button elements styled with jQuery CSS to match the style of the Tabs widget. I used some jQuery javascript to link the buttons so clicking each lab description button would pop up the matching modal with that lab's instructions.
