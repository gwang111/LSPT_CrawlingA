# Quiz 1 Question 2

I started this question by placing the quiz HTML file in my site directory, according to my IA, and creating a CSS file for it. Then I quickly created a quiz landing page and linked to the HTML file.

After that I started to work on the CSS to make the quiz HTML look similar to the style of the rest of my site. I started out by dropping in CSS that I used in a different file, and then modifying it so that it would apply to the HTML.

For this question I took the approach that I would modify the original HTML file as little as possible because the question seems to be focused on our ability to use CSS. However, I quickly realized that the HTML file wasn't really formed correctly. The questions were nested inside the previous question's `<div>`, and one of the questions was missing a `<div>`, so I fixed that. I also fixed a missing `</ul>` closing tag for the instructions `<div>`.

Then surrounded all of the questions with a div so I could use flex box on them. I also changed the outline of the instructions to the matching orange color that I use on my site, and also moved the `<h3>` tag outside of the unordered list so that it could center correctly. Then I spent some time reducing the margin around heading tags so things would space more nicely, and also colored some text differently + added underlining so it would stand out better.
